An implementation of the Newton method for solving linear programming
problems.

Solves problems in the following form:
(c, x) -> min, A * x = b, x >= 0.

Takes a description of linear programming problem from the stdin and
writes answer (optimal vector x* and optimal function value (c, x*))
to the stdout.

Description of a problem must be given in the following form:
m n

A_00 ... A_0n
...       ...
A_m0 ... A_mn

b_0 ... b_m

c_0 ... c_n

beta external_tolerance internal_tolerance
